# Ansible-files-for-aggregating-ESXi-logs

This GitHub repository has Ansible files from a project I created in 2021, where I used Ansible to collect logs from my VMware ESXi home lab. For more information about the project, check out my first post on it here: https://hightechdilettante.wordpress.com/2021/04/13/aggregating-esxi-logs-with-ansible/
